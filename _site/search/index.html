        "content": "Reliable  data    transfer    using   UDPIntroduction“Reliable data transfer using UDP (User Datagram Protocol – RFC 768) for file transfer” is a client-server application. The reliability over UDP is achieved using Alternating Bit(AB) or Selective Repeat(SR) protocol. UDP, unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), is an unreliable, connectionless data transfer protocol existing in the transport layer of TCP/IP architecture. The primary purpose of this project is to download a big file from a server residing in different IP location using one of these protocols i.e. either SRP or ABP.Alternating Bit Protocol(ABP) is a connection-less protocol used to transfer one-directional the message between client and server. It is, in fact, the simplest form of a sliding window protocol where sequence number alternates between 1 and 0, and the window size is of one. In ABP, a request or ACK message is sent from a client to the server with AB 1 or 0, and upon receiving a response from the server, AB is flipped (1-0 or 0-1) and again a new request is sent with new AB info. If the desired response is not received from the server, a request is again sent by the client without flipping the AB. Thus, looking at the AB sent by the client, the server decides whether to send a new packet or to retransmitted the old one.Selective Repeat Protocol(SRP) is also connectionless protocol. But unlike ABP, server parallelly sends a certain number of packets (default 10 in our case) for each new request from the client. Once receiving the packets from the server, clients somehow verify the sequence of the received packets. Upon verifying, the client can know about the missing packets – if there are any. The client sends a request for those missing packets and repeats the process until all the packets for a particular request are received. Otherwise, it requests for the fresh set of packets from the server.This project has implemented both Selective Repeat protocol and Alternating Bit protocol along with UDP. In regard to the project, a client makes an HTTP request to the server requesting a file to download. Server checks if the requested file exists or not. If the file exists, server splits the file into many segments of specific UDP length (say, 1024bytes). A packet is created for each split, which contains checksum as SHA1(20-byte hash of data), data length, sequence number, and/or alternating bit. The client, upon receiving the packet, verifies it, re-computing the hash, and performs a necessary action which may be saving the packet or requesting for retransmission. Retransmission can occur in various scenarios. Such as, if a packet is lost, or if a checksum is not validated, or if some sequence is missed –selective repeat case. All the action performed during this process are saved on a file and also are displayed in the console – i.e. both of client and server.Problem StatementThe application should consist a client program and a server program. The server program hosts files and responds to requests for files. It breaks the requested file into segments and sends them to the client over UDP. The client program takes a file name as input and requests the file from the server. The programs should handle UDP packet losses to make sure that the entire file is correctly received by the client program. The code needs to include implementation of the Alternating Bit and Selective Repeat protocols. Refer chapter 3.4 (Principles of Reliable Data Transfer) - Computer Networking, Kurose to understand these two protocols.The client program should print detailed information about any requests sent and data received at byte level (e.g., time X received byte Y to Z) during the file download. Server program should print detailed information about any requests received and data sent at the byte level. Client program and server program should be run on different machines in different networks.Architecture DescriptionThe top-level architecture of the project is shown below in figure 3.2. Basically, it contains a client process and a server process. The client process implements various methods via different classes such as client connection, transport, and file handler. Client connection creates a socket, handle requests and responses. It also holds some parameters, such as IP address, port number, message, an error bit, alternative bit handler and so on. Transport creates the packets, implements selective repeat and an alternating bit, verifies the received packets and so on. File handler performs necessary action to the packet sent by transport, it saves the packet or sends back the error message to the transport – if the file is not saved. In addition, the client process also contains methods such as exception handler, alternating bit and selective repeat handler, and so on.The server facilitates the file transfer process via various methods existing in different classes such as server connection, server packet, and file handler. Server connection creates a socket, send and receive requests and responses. Like the client connection, it also holds parameters such as IP address and port number of the client to sends back the response. File handler class checks if the requested file exists or not, if exist, it reads the file and divide it into no of the chunk of a specific size. Each chunk is sent to the server packet class, where the given chunk(data) is serialized, checksum, length, a sequence number is calculated. And finally, the packet is made ready to be sent to the client. Other various functions are also created on the server side such as selective repeat, alternating bit, exception handler etc. to support the file transfer process. Generally, these methods perform the same action as that of corresponding client functions. In addition to these, all the intermediate actions are printed on the client and on the server console. These actions include the requested file name, file status, sequence number sent and received and soon.Architecture DiagramFigure: UDP file download system architectureFlow, State, and class DiagramThe high-level flow, state and the class diagram of the project are shown below. Some the functionalities may not exactly depict the implementation. Thus, the diagrams are intended to give a general upper-level overview of the project only.Flow DiagramThe flow diagram of the UPD file transfer is shown in the image below.Figure: Flow Diagram - UPD file download process using client-server modelNote: The symbols used in the flow diagram are adopted from the standard flow diagram design.State DiagramFigure: State diagram, client-server - request-response processFigure: State Diagram - Alternate bit protocolReference: Computer Networking – A top-down approach 6th edition, Kurose, RossClass DiagramsFigure: Class Diagram UDP Client ProgramFigure: Class Diagram UDP Server ProgramImplementation“Reliable data transfer using UDP” implements a file transfer mechanism to send a big data file from the server to the client as a response to a client request. As UDP is an unreliable protocol, the reliability is added to the transfer process either by alternating bit or selective repeat protocol. Since these protocols are contrasting to each other, on them can be selected for the file transfer process.DescriptionBefore the execution of client/server programs, it is very important to choose either selective repeat or alternating bit at first, and this can only be done by going to the code itself. It is very “important” to choose the same method on both sides, otherwise, program execution terminates or may continueon loop. Once the selection is done, the server program is executed first, and upon successful execution, it waits for the client request.- execution of client/server program: &lt; python UDPClient/UDPServer.py &gt;Similarly, the client program is also executed and prompts the user to input the file name to download from the server. Now the client makes all the necessary setup up before sending a request to the server. A setup such as initialize server IP and port, bind IP and port to create an address, and finally create a socket.client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)It also imports various global variables ( type, sequence counter, alternating bit etc. ) from the client config. The type variable tells sever if the request is of type acknowledgment or data. Sequence counter stores the information about all the received sequence number and an alternating bit to assist the same process. In case of SR, AB is always set to 1 and it acts as ACK message only. Upon completion of this setup, the client creates a UDP packet and sends a request to the server for the initiation of file transfer. The server receives the request, verifies if the file exists or not. If the file exists, it creates a small chunk of default size 1024 and stores it in a dictionary. Packets are created out of these chunks and are also stored in a dictionary. Each UDP packets created by server contains the following information- checksum : Check sum of the data- length : Length of the data- seqNo : Sequence number of the packet- msg : Data or message to be send- total_packets : Collection of all the packets- total_number_of_packets : Total no of packets available Now, on the basis of the selected method, server start sending the packets, either 1 at a time in case of ABP, or 10 packets in case of SRP. Server response can be a new transmission of data or re-transmission in case of packet loss. Moreover, if the file is not found at the first hand, it sends a “file not found” exception to the client. Client waiting for server response, receives the packet (in some case it may not receive as well), send it to the transport for the verification of the packet. Transport, dissect the packet, calculate the checksum and length, verify it against the received parameters and upon verification, it sends the data to the file handler. And so, file handler writes the data to the file. During this process, the client may undergo time out or may receive distorted packets, in both of these cases it requests the server for the retransmission. The basic rule for retransmission in case of ABP is, if the received AB from the client is different than the one existing on the server, the server performs retransmission. Similarly, in case of SRP, the client notifies server about the specific missing packets, and server retransmits them. This process continues until all the packets from the server are received by the client. Client upon receiving all the packets from the server sends an ACK with type = ‘c’ (c for complete) to the server. Receiving ACK ‘c’ server closes the connection and terminates the transmission process with transmission complete message. There also exists some other helper functions such as exception handler – to track/handle, and print exceptions, missing sequence verifier - client process, to verify missing sequence in case of SRP and so on. All the class and function names are presented in the Appendix.Technical Specifications  Python 3.x+ for client and server programming  Python socket library for the network socket  Hashlib for the computation of hash  Pickle for the serialization of data  Note: Whole project is developed under a virtual environment so the project contains  all the necessary libraries and the python environment as well.Limitations  Selection of method ABP or SRP should be done by going to the code itself  The program cannot handle unexpected connection loss cases, so it needs a manual restart of the process in case of connection loss.  Only data file can be transferred, it doesn’t support transfer of media or any other types of files  The program may contain various bugs due to the lack of proper code reviewFuture Enhancement  To support various file type such as audio, video, image etc.  Functionalities to handle unexpected connection losses, and start re-transmission from where it was interrupted  The process is not parallel enough, such as when the client is in the process of packet/s verification at some intermediate point, the server remains idle in such case. Thus, additional parallelism and functionalities can be introduced to maximize the efficiency of server and client.

        "content": "Once in my childhood, I asked my father the meaning of poverty when I didn’t get money for a picnic. He replied, “Poverty is not just scarce of money, it’s perfectly a relative word that differs from person to person”. He further said, “Poverty means basically inferiority or scarcity; you are in scarce of money so you think yourself poor, that’s it!”Today I feel that poverty is only the reason for a person to be evil or sapiens. Today I want to share some views of the children I met in the capital city of Nepal i.e. Kathmandu. Kathmandu is the city of hope and opportunities. Yearly, thousands of people enter the city in search of quality life and better education but there are very fewer people who get success in their aim but what about those people who do not succeed? What about their children who come along with them? And what about the life of those people? I feel from the inner core of my heart this helpless situation is the reason for the creation of evil practice in the society. I don’t want to blame those helpless people but to the situation that makes them evil as stated above i.e. due to scarcity. We all know who is responsible for this situation and talking about their responsibility will be worthless. Hungry stomach never thinks about country neither it thinks about tomorrow.Once I met a child near Newroad gate while I was traveling back to home from college. He was begging for one rupee. First, I didn’t care but when he pleaded I gave him one rupee. With a new hope and innocent smile, he ran away. Next day I found the same boy having drugs on Tundhikhel ground. followed him and eventually caught him. I scolded him meanwhile I felt mercy on him seeing his tears. After than I asked him his name, he replied – Dorje. He was 11 years old all the way from mid-western part of the country (Dolpa) like thousands of others who came to Kathmandu 3 years ago with his parents with the hope for a better state of quality of life. Presently he doesn’t know where his parents are and he told he don’t even care about them. I asked him why you don’t care about them? He replied that when he came to Kathmandu his parents said him that now onwards they will have a better life in Kathmandu and they will send him to a better school for their better future. After he came to Kathmandu as a child just 11 years old was excited, but his excitement ended soon when he found his whole family sleeping in street for half part of the very week of their arrival. They just ate nearly nothing but their hope, dreams, and future plans and eating even very little food was a day dream. Their struggle stepped into the third day he eventually saw his parents quite frustrating and physically as well as mentally tired. The fourth day with the rise of the sun he woke up what seem to shatter him more, suddenly in the busy street he found his parents were already gone leaving him alone.With no hope, he started his life with street children and he said me that the major work of all street children like him in Kathmandu is stealing and begging and using the maximum money they get in using drugs. According to him, the drug is the right chemical substance with which they can eat any sorts of cheap food they get thrown in street or even if they don’t get food because it makes them so dozy and unconscious whole day that they could survive even without food. He says he wanted to earn a lot of money in his future but he didn’t know the way to earn it. At last, he said me, “Are you going to give me some pennies?” Laughingly after a while, he ran away without taking any money.After a month of this incident, I again met other interesting groups of street children near one river (locally called Dhobikhola, one of the most polluted river in Kathmandu after Bagmati, near Sattalle, 2 km from Chabahil, but these children were quite different children than those I met in Newroad. They were using some scientific method for fishing. In a developed nation, it is called electrical fishing. These children had wire, joined in a metallic plate which was attached to a wooden stick. After dipping the wooden stick in the water the fish got electric shock along the wire through the plate with high voltage that came from the street AC supply. They used it to catch a lot of fish. One of the active members of that fishing group Surendra Lama said that previous day they have caught over 50 kg fish in the same river. They sold those fish in the market and got some money. He further said that his parents were very poor and could not full fill their basic needs (food, cloth, and shelter). After doing this job, he has been able to full fill his part of basic needs. He said he had never gone to school and neither have got any formal education.I asked him how he knew this technique. He smilingly replied, “What do you think we street children don’t know anything?” I felt rather this was a simple thing for me as or us. But this is not simple for those who have not been to school for a single day. We learned science very early in school and are still afraid to plug in a simple wire, but these children know to handle complex wire connections, it was really amazing.Our country has just come out from long civil war. Most of the energetic youth are out of country and tomorrow’s generation i.e. these children are still facing such struggling situation of full filling basic needs. These two examples of children Dorje and Surendra might help us to understand the future of Nepal and the present situation on them.The above characters that I am trying to show are of completely different situation although facing a common problem. The common problem is that both of the characters are hungry. Their sense of hunger is not only for food but is for their life. Happiness shatters at their door. They hear intolerable words which matter a lot. They sleep in the bed of thorns of reality keeping pillow of tears. They are just slums and khate (खाते) for educated individuals. They are also a fund collecting machines for many governmental and nongovernmental organizations.Wearing a clean and creased dress and watching them from a semi-dark scenario that is behind the looking glass of BMW’s and VOLSWOGEANS won’t let anyone realize their state of existence. Although they are grown up around us, their world varies a lot from our well full filled sophisticated life. They just live in the third world around us. Their journey is a story of long pain hidden in the dendrites(Adhesive) which they inhale. Their shabby shoes, torn dress, dirty skin, unconscious eyes and a hand full of plastics marks their identity. Our busy life and aim are making us so conscious that we are dimming away from these unconscious members of our own society but truth is always behind us and the way through which we are moving is leading us to an unknown state of reality of our own people.",

### Questions 
what was before the before      
what will be after the after      
what is the sorrow in tears      
who is the joy in laughter?

where dwells the mind curious   
who is the fury in furious   
why is a scene seen by the seer   
when is now, where is here?   

what is the reason in random   
why is the heat in hot   
who liveth in life   
what is, but naught?     

### Answers   
Before was there before the before   
after will be there after the after   
there are tears, and sorrow is just a fear    
there is laughter, and joy is just a share   

Mind dwells for the lost reminisce   
and the distraction acts fury in the furious    
no scene, but the hope is drift by the seer   
yesterday was now and rosy was here   

I can't see when its dark   
I lost my grain when you were born   
I traveled far before with the sun    
I hound the self who live beneath    
**null is all, and all is null**

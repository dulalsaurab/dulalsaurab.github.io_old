**Note:**: This is an archive post from 2013 and octree construction is used for NNS. 

Octree is a type of data-structure especially used for particle tracking in CFD(computational fluid dynamics) and also for the nearest neighbor search. 
It is also a space partition method which is similar to binary tree but having 
eight children, means each internal node of an octree have eight children. 
The general meaning of octree is oct + tree, which means a given cube is divided into 
eight smaller cube. The division is shown below

### Construction of octree in brief
* The space containing all the particles (say millions) are enclose within a cube   
* The length and side of cube are determined by the minimum *(Xmin, Ymin, Zmin)* value and maximum *(Xmax, Ymax, Zmax)* value of coordinate of distribution of particles.  
* Now, the parent cube is divided into eight smaller cube of length l/2 of parent cube, where l is the length of parent cube.   
* A coordinate of new cube is obtained from the parent cube with certain mathematical calculation on it's side (l). 
* The cube is further divided recursive if the parent cube contain more than one particle in it.   
* The depth of division of cube is predefined or can be divided until a single particle is enclosed within a child cube.   
* The track of each particle is kept, let’s say we have particle P(x, y, z) shown in above figure of cube, for the particular of value x, y and z, the particle P lies on the cube at
m9, m10, m11, m14, m16, V7, m17, m19.    
* Similarly the track of co-ordinate of STL triangle (it is a triangular representation of 3d data) is kept, i.e. the vertex v1 of triangle P
lies on some of the cube.   

### The mathematical recursive formula for construction of octree
Let’s us assume the name of eight cubes which is constructed form the internal parent cube be   
*left_top_front, left_top_back, left_down_front, left_down_back, right_top_front, right_top_back, 
right_down_front, right_down_back*. 
Suppose the length of the parent cube is *“l”* and the cube with its vertex are taken from the above figure. 
Below case if for the cube being at the origin but for the actual practice *Xmix, Ymin* , *Zmin* is added to the origin. 
Now the minimum and maximum coordinate of the child cube can be obtain as follow   
```left_top_front = (m6, m5) = ((0, l/2, 0), (l/2.l, l/2))```      
```left_top_back = (m13, m3) = ((0, l/2, l/2), (l/2.l, l))```     
```left_down_front = (V4, m14) = ((0, 0, 0), (l/2.l/2, l/2))```      
```left_down_back = (m18, m11) = ((0, 0, l/2), (l/2.l/2, l))```   
```right_top_front = (m7, m2) = ((l/2, l/2, 0), (l.l, l/2))```   
```right_top_back = (m14, m6) = ((l/2, l/2, l/2), (l. l, l))```   
```right_down_front = (m15, m9) = ((l/2, 0, 0), (l, l/2, l/2))```    
```right_down_back = (m19, m10) = ((l/2, 0, l/2), (l, l/2, l))```

Thus, using above formula the octree can be constructed recursively.

### NNS using octree

* First of all the sample point is taken say P(x, y, z).
* Now the cube containing this sample point is found out by traversing the tree using BFS.
* After the cube is found out, the other cube nearer to its surface and edge are found out
traversing the tree again.
* Since each cube in an octree contain certain particles so all the particles lying to the
nearer cube is found out and placed in certain data structure.
* Fnally, the distance between the candidate particle and all the other search particle is
found out so that to discover the nearest distance and eventually the nearest particle.

<p>It flows incessantly and will forever<br />
 though the language is full of suggestions<br />
 in the way of language <br />
but they are all anonymous,<br />
 and it’s almost your music next to my bones<br />
I am feeling it deep inside, it’s first of yours without my presence <br />
after we meet, …. long after we departed <br />
I see the world have changed, mountains turned to sea<br />
land full of flowers, those cracks are gone, and beauty all around </p>

<p>these nights we hear the horses running in the rain <br />
it stops and the moon comes out and we are still here <br />
 the leaks in the roof go on dripping after the rain has passed <br />
 smell of ginger flowers slips through the dark house  <br />
down near the sea the slow heart of the beacon flashes  </p>

<p>the long way to you is still tied to me but it brought me to you  <br />
 I keep wanting to give you what is already your<br />
s it is the morning of the mornings together <br />
breath of summer oh my found one  <br />
the sleep in the same current and each waking to you</p>

<p>when I open my eyes you are what I wanted to see,” <br />
when I be with God you are what I wanted to wish,”    <br />
when I be gone you are where I wanted to reach”<br />
and… glimpse you cease your dream every day</p>

It flows incessantly and will forever  
 though the language is full of suggestions  
 in the way of language   
but they are all anonymous,  
 and it's almost your music next to my bones  
I am feeling it deep inside, it’s first of yours without my presence   
after we meet, …. long after we departed   
I see the world have changed, mountains turned to sea  
land full of flowers, those cracks are gone, and beauty all around    

these nights we hear the horses running in the rain   
it stops and the moon comes out and we are still here   
 the leaks in the roof go on dripping after the rain has passed   
 smell of ginger flowers slips through the dark house    
down near the sea the slow heart of the beacon flashes     

the long way to you is still tied to me but it brought me to you    
 I keep wanting to give you what is already your  
s it is the morning of the mornings together   
breath of summer oh my found one    
the sleep in the same current and each waking to you   

when I open my eyes you are what I wanted to see,”   
when I be with God you are what I wanted to wish,”      
when I be gone you are where I wanted to reach”  
and… glimpse you cease your dream every day   

***― W.S. Merwin and Me***

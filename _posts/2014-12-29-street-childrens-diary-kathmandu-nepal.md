Once in my childhood, I asked my father the meaning of poverty when I didn’t get money for a picnic. 
He replied, “Poverty is not just scarce of money, it’s perfectly a relative word that differs from 
person to person”. He further said, “Poverty means basically inferiority or scarcity; you are in scarce 
of money so you think yourself poor, that’s it!”      
  


Today I feel that poverty is only the reason for a person to be evil or sapiens. Today I want to share 
me views of the children I met in the capital city of Nepal i.e. Kathmandu. Kathmandu is the city of 
hope and opportunities. Yearly, thousands of people enter the city in search of quality life and 
better education but there are very fewer people who get success in their aim but what about those 
people who do not succeed? What about their children who come along with them? And what about the 
life of those people? I feel from the inner core of my heart this helpless situation is the reason 
for the creation of evil practice in the society. I don’t want to blame those helpless people but to 
the situation that makes them evil as stated above i.e. due to scarcity. We all know who is responsible 
for this situation and talking about their responsibility will be worthless. Hungry stomach never 
thinks about country neither it thinks about tomorrow.




Once I met a child near Newroad gate while I was traveling back to home from college. He was 
begging for one rupee. First, I didn't care but when he pleaded I gave him one rupee. With a 
new hope and innocent smile, he ran away. Next day I found the same boy having drugs on Tundhikhel 
ground. followed him and eventually caught him. I scolded him meanwhile I felt mercy on him seeing 
his tears. After than I asked him his name, he replied – Dorje. He was 11 years old all the way from 
mid-western part of the country (Dolpa) like thousands of others who came to Kathmandu 3 years ago 
with his parents with the hope for a better state of quality of life. Presently he doesn’t know where 
is parents are and he told he don’t even care about them. I asked him why you don’t care about them? 
He replied that when he came to Kathmandu his parents said him that now onwards they will have a 
better life in Kathmandu and they will send him to a better school for their better future. After 
he came to Kathmandu as a child just 11 years old was excited, but his excitement ended soon when 
he found his whole family sleeping in street for half part of the very week of their arrival. They 
just ate nearly nothing but their hope, dreams, and future plans and eating even very little food was 
a day dream. Their struggle stepped into the third day he eventually saw his parents quite frustrating 
nd physically as well as mentally tired. The fourth day with the rise of the sun he woke up what seem 
o shatter him more, suddenly in the busy street he found his parents were already gone leaving him 
alone.




With no hope, he started his life with street children and he said me that the major work of all 
street children like him in Kathmandu is stealing and begging and using the maximum money they get 
in using drugs. According to him, the drug is the right chemical substance with which they can eat 
any sorts of cheap food they get thrown in street or even if they don’t get food because it makes 
them so dozy and unconscious whole day that they could survive even without food. He says he wanted 
to earn a lot of money in his future but he didn’t know the way to earn it. At last, he said me, 
“Are you going to give me some pennies?” Laughingly after a while, he ran away without taking any money.




After a month of this incident, I again met other interesting groups of street children near one 
river (locally called Dhobikhola, one of the most polluted river in Kathmandu after Bagmati, near 
Sattalle, 2 km from Chabahil, but these children were quite different children than those I met in 
Newroad. They were using some scientific method for fishing. In a developed nation, it is called 
electrical fishing. These children had wire, joined in a metallic plate which was attached to a 
wooden stick. After dipping the wooden stick in the water the fish got electric shock along the 
wire through the plate with high voltage that came from the street AC supply. They used it to 
catch a lot of fish. One of the active members of that fishing group Surendra Lama said that previous 
day they have caught over 50 kg fish in the same river. They sold those fish in the market and got 
some money. He further said that his parents were very poor and could not full fill their basic 
needs (food, cloth, and shelter). After doing this job, he has been able to full fill his part 
of basic needs. He said he had never gone to school and neither have got any formal education.

  


I asked him how he knew this technique. He smilingly replied, “What do you think we street 
children don’t know anything?” I felt rather this was a simple thing for me as or us. But this 
is not simple for those who have not been to school for a single day. We learned science very 
early in school and are still afraid to plug in a simple wire, but these children know to handle 
complex wire connections, it was really amazing.

  

Our country has just come out from long civil war. Most of the energetic youth are out of 
country and tomorrow’s generation i.e. these children are still facing such struggling situation 
of full filling basic needs. These two examples of children Dorje and Surendra might help us to 
understand the future of Nepal and the present situation on them.

  

The above characters that I am trying to show are of completely different situation although 
facing a common problem. The common problem is that both of the characters are hungry. Their 
sense of hunger is not only for food but is for their life. Happiness shatters at their door. 
They hear intolerable words which matter a lot. They sleep in the bed of thorns of reality 
keeping pillow of tears. They are just slums and khate (खाते) for educated individuals. They 
are also a fund collecting machines for many governmental and nongovernmental organizations.

  

Wearing a clean and creased dress and watching them from a semi-dark scenario that is behind the 
looking glass of BMW's and VOLSWOGEANS won't let anyone realize their state of existence. 
Although they are grown up around us, their world varies a lot from our well full filled 
sophisticated life. They just live in the third world around us. Their journey is a story of 
long pain hidden in the dendrites(Adhesive) which they inhale. Their shabby shoes, torn dress, 
dirty skin, unconscious eyes and a hand full of plastics marks their identity. Our busy life and 
aim are making us so conscious that we are dimming away from these unconscious members of our own 
society but truth is always behind us and the way through which we are moving is leading us to an 
unknown state of reality of our own people.
